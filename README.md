# TwitchBotBlocker
Author: MadiSperry

This program is designed to work with Google Chrome.
Google Chrome software MUST be in any subversion of 93 which can be seen here: chrome://settings/help

I created this Python program to block some known follower and viewer bots that have spammed my own personal twitch channel as well as a few fellow streamers. 
To run this program, please read through all of the comments so you understand how the whole process works. With 2 Factor Auth., this code is not able to be 
fully automated. However, I have minimalized the areas where human interaction is needed. The only two places where a human is needed to assist the code, is
for the 2 Factor Auth. and if the streamer is offline it will have a button on their channel that says "Chat" that will need to be manually clicked. This code
has config variables at the top of top of the code for you to configure specifics such as your personal log in info, the streamers username, the directory of 
these files, and the delay you would like between actions.
